When submitting an idea, consider these few points; 

- It's the little things that matter.
- This site started during the corona outbreak. We prefer ideas that one can do while at home.
- We prefer ideas that won't be a burden on a budget. Money is tight for a lot of folks. 
- We prefer ideas that are easy to pick up for most people. It helps if a tip is general. 
- We prefer ideas that are specific. Cooking is great, but it's a large topic. Instead, "perfecting a pizza" would be better.
