```
wget https://thismonth.rocks/tips.json
```

## How To Contribute 

If you want to contribute, feel free to add (or update!) a file to the `src/ideas` folder and add a PR. The icons will be handled by the maintainer and are retreived from [the nounproject](https://thenounproject.com/). 

When submitting an idea, consider these few points; 

- It's the little things that matter.
- We prefer ideas that won't be a burden on a budget. Money is tight for a lot of folks. 
- We prefer ideas that are easy to pick up for most people. It helps if a tip is relevant for a crowd of people. Not a niche. 
- We prefer ideas that are specific. Cooking is great, but it's a large topic. Instead, "perfecting a pizza" would be better. 
- We prefer ideas that make it easier for people to practice social distancing. Content that helps with kids is *much* appreciated. 

This project is also an experiment. Feel free to discuss cool ideas in the issue list as well.
