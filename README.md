# thismonth.rocks

A collaborative motivational website to encourage you to do something special this month.

## API 

The website exposes the ideas as a json blob. You can see it [here](https://thismonth.rocks/tips.json) or download it via; 

```
wget https://thismonth.rocks/tips.json
```

## How To Contribute 

If you want to contribute, feel free to add a file to the `src/ideas` folder and add a PR. The icons will be handled by the maintainer and are retreived from [the nounproject](https://thenounproject.com/). 

When submitting an idea, consider these few points; 

- It's the little things that matter.
- We prefer ideas that won't be a burden on a budget. Money is tight for a lot of folks. 
- We prefer ideas that are easy to pick up for most people. It helps if a tip is general. 
- We prefer ideas that are specific. Cooking is great, but it's a large topic. Instead, "perfecting a pizza" would be better. 

This project is also an experiment. Feel free to discuss cool ideas in the issue list as well.
