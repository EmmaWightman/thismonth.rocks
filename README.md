## How To Contribute A New Idea

If you want to contribute, feel free to add a file to the `src/ideas` folder and add a PR. The icons will be handled by the maintainer and are retreived from [the nounproject](https://thenounproject.com/). 

When submitting an idea, consider these few points; 

- It's the little things that matter.
- We prefer ideas that won't be a burden on a budget. Money is tight for a lot of folks. 
- We prefer ideas that are easy to pick up for most people. It helps if a tip is relevant for a crowd of people. Not a niche. 
- We prefer ideas that are specific. Cooking is great, but it's a large topic. Instead, "perfecting a pizza" would be better. 
- We prefer ideas that make it easier for people to practice social distancing. Content that helps with kids is *much* appreciated. 

This project is also an experiment. Feel free to discuss cool ideas in the issue list as well.

## How To Add an Appendix

If you want to contribute, feel free to update a file in the `src/ideas` folder and add a PR. 

When giving context, consider these few points; 

- Mobile phones have limited screen real estate. Best keep it short.
- It would be great if we can support local businesses who are hit hard by the pandemic. Adding something like "If possible, consider buying the book from a local book-store." goes a long way. 
- Don't overdo it. Just give short meaningful places where folks can find out more when they're inspired. 
- We're here to inspire, not to do marketing or sales pitches.
