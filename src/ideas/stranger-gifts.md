The largest gift exchange on the planet is [reddit gifts](https://www.redditgifts.com/). They 
offer all sorts of categories for gift giving and they have a match-making process. You can
 send a gift to Slovenia and get one from Africa. 

There's some gems that were given too. There's that time when 
[Arnold Schwarzenegger drew a cat](https://www.redditgifts.com/gallery/secret-santa-2013/gift/secret-santa-revealed/) and
that time when somebody sent a [fully functional safe](https://www.redditgifts.com/gallery/secret-santa-2014/gift/whats-safe-2/).

The best advice here is go to overboard with decorations. It's a great feeling to make
somebody feel special. Especially if the whole world is doing it.
